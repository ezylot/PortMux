# PortMux
### Port Multiplexer - One port to rule them all

This project was called into life because of a problem that should not exist anymore, but unfortunately still does.

The problem is, that many Routers that are shipped to customers still do not offer the possibility to add custom port-forwarding.
Instead, people must call their provider and ask for every port, sometimes without success.

This project should decrease annoyance by removing the necessity to forward a different port for every application.
